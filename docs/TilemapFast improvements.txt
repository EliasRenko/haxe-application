Remaining Optimizations to Consider:
Frustum Culling: Only render visible tiles
Instanced Rendering: More efficient for repeated tiles
Adaptive Thresholds: Scale thresholds based on map size
Sparse Representation: Don't allocate vertices for empty tiles
Memory Pooling: Reuse arrays to reduce GC pressure
